	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	 <p>
        Time complexity measures how long an algorithm takes to run as the input size increases. It helps evaluate how efficient an algorithm is in terms of processing time. Efficient algorithms perform well even as input sizes grow.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to how much memory an algorithm needs as input size grows. It is usually expressed in Big O notation, such as O(n), to describe how the required space scales with input size.
